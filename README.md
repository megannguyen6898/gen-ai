# Virtual Data Analyst

Build a prototype of virtual analyst that can answer analytical questions on the dataset. The dataset includes customersâ€™ data with different statistics such as grades, term length, loan status, etc.

## Solution

The virtual analyst solution design incorporates modules for parsing user queries, analyzing lending trends, extracting data, and handling user interactions.
It involves a collaboration between humans and LLM (Language Model) algorithms, where humans provide domain expertise and LLMs assist in natural language understanding and analysis.
The solution aims to optimize lending strategies, mitigate risks, and provide market insights.
